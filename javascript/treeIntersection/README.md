# Tree Intersection Function

A function that takes two binary trees as parameters. Returns an array of values found in both trees, if any.

## Challenge

To use the `Hashtable` implementation to store tree node values as keys, with a value of `true` or `false` if the number is a duplicate or not. Return just the keys of the table that have a value of `true`.
